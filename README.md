# HS-SF-integration
## Project Overview
The HireSmith-Salesforce Integration for Student Data (Phase 6) project, launched on September 28, 2023, marks a significant step towards enhancing the data integration process between HireSmith and Salesforce platforms. This project focuses on one-way data flow from Salesforce to HireSmith, prioritizing data consistency, efficient python code development, and effective use of MySQL for database management. The integration ensures system performance and usability. The initiative substantially reduces manual effort by automating data entry, supporting efficient job search activities within the Smith School's career portal, and representing a strategic collaboration with Smith IT to ensure a smooth and automated data flow.
## Context and Integration Process
Historically, the HireSmith platform relied on manual data updates from SIS (Student Information System) and ERx (External Reporting System) processes managed by the Office of Career Services (OCS). This project revolutionizes this approach by introducing an automated data flow system. The necessity for automation stems from the inefficiencies inherent in the previous manual data update processes, which this project aims to address. Under this new regime, data originally coming in from SIS and ERx will first flow into the Salesforce platform, managed by Smith IT, and then transferred into the MySQL database, populating the student profile and student degree tables. This in turn, gets transformed into appropriate data frames which will be utilized for REST API calls.

Our collaboration with Smith IT has been pivotal in aligning the Salesforce student database with the requirements of our project. Multiple meetings were held to ensure a mutual understanding of the fields to be included and how they would integrate into our system. This new automated process aims to enhance accuracy and efficiency in data integration, replacing previous manual procedures.
